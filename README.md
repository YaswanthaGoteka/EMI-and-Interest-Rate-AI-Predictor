# EMI-and-Interest-Rate-AI-Predictor
This script loads and cleans loan data, encodes categorical fields, and trains two models: an XGBoost regressor to predict monthly EMI, interest rate, and loan term, and a Random Forest classifier to predict loan approval. It evaluates performance and lets users input details to get real-time loan predictions and approval probability.
