# EMI-and-Interest-Rate-AI-Predictor
This script loads and cleans loan data, encodes categorical fields, and trains two models: an XGBoost regressor to predict monthly EMI, interest rate, and loan term, and a Random Forest classifier to predict loan approval. It evaluates performance and lets users input details to get real-time loan predictions and approval probability.

Dataset (.csv):
- Arif Miah Â· Personal Finance ML Dataset from Kaggle

Imports:
- pandas (read data)
- LabelEncoder (encode data to train)
- train_test_split (training and testing model)
- RandomForestClassifier (Model used to predict EMI, Interest Rate, and Loan Term)
- mean_squared_error, r2_score, mean_absolute_error, accuracy_score (evaluation methods to test accurcy of model)
- XGBRegressor
- MultiOutputRegressor

## This is a fined a model from scratch.
## Proof:Training from scratch means you initialize a model with 
## random weights (or a fresh, untrained instance) and train it entirely 
## on your dataset from the beginning. No prior knowledge is used.

## I created most of this with my own knowledge but I also used AI (ChatGPT) 
## to debug and make it better like adding 
## the Approval Probability for the output. Otherwise I have done everything Myself :)
